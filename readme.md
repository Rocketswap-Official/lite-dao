# Lite DAO

### A non-custodial voting system

## How it works

#### fn: create_proposal
* Anyone can create a proposal by calling the `create_proposal` method given they have enough token to pay the fee. Each proposal has a unique ID, which is retrieved from ProposalCount. ProposalCount increments after a new proposal is created.

#### fn: cast_ballot
* Users vote using the `cast_ballot` method. 
* Anyone who holds tokens, staked tokens, lp or staked lp can cast a ballot using before `date_decision`. Ballots cast are final and cannot be changed.
* Each ballot cast increments `BallotCount[proposal_id]`
* When a ballot is cast, it is recorded in `Ballots[proposal_id]` along with a forwards_index and a backwards_index for looking up the ballot by user_vk and also by ballot_id. This is to prevent one vk casting multiple ballots.

#### fn: count_ballots
* After `date_decision` no more ballots can be cast and `count_ballots` can be called. * `count_ballots` iterates through all cast ballots, calculates the weight for each ballot and records the value in `CountedBallots`. 
* `count_ballots` can be called until all ballots have been processed.
* Since the application counts the ballots in batches, there is a edge case where a savvy adversary could cause mischief and potentially vote with their coins more than once, by moving coins from one address to another in between batches. 
* For this reason we have included in a verification step which assures that tokens which are used to vote cannot be used to vote a second time.
* Once `count_ballots` has been called for a proposal and has counted all the ballots `verify_ballots` can be called.

#### fn: verify_ballots

* Can be called once `count_ballots` has concluded
* ensures that the token balances in accounts have not changed dramatically since being counted.
* to be called in batches, once all ballots have been verified the Proposal is marked as `concluded` and the results are considered final.
